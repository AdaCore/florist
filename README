NORMAL INSTALLATION:

Follow the steps described in the INSTALL file.

COMPILING YOUR PROGRAMS WITH FLORIST:

To compile your own programs with Florist, you will need to include
the gnatmake parameters that specify where to find the
Florist sources and object library file. Usually the following command
will be enough:

$ gnatmake -Ifloristlib main -largs -lflorist

If you don't want to keep around the whole Florist installation
directory, you should be able to copy or move the subdirectory
"floristlib" to some other location, and then include it in
your GNAT source and object library search paths (see the GNAT documentation
for more details).
