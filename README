FLORIST:
========

This directory contains the components of FLORIST, an
implementation of the IEEE Standards 1003.5: 1992, IEEE STD
1003.5b: 1996, and parts of IEEE STD 1003.5c: 1998, also known as
the POSIX Ada Bindings.

NORMAL INSTALLATION:
====================

Follow the steps described in the INSTALL file.

COMPILING YOUR PROGRAMS WITH FLORIST:
=====================================

The recommended approach for linking your application with Florist
is to import Florist's project from your application's project file
using GPRbuild's project management features, by adding the following
"with" statement:

    with "florist.gpr".

See section 2.3.1 of the GPRbuild and GPR Companion Tools User's Guide
for more information on how to configure gprbuild to find Florist's
project file, or where to install florist so as to allow gprbuild to
find it automatically.

The Florist library's project file, florist.gpr, that should be used
to import the project is found at:

    <install-prefix>/share/gpr/florist.gpr

Alternatively, to use Florist without GPRbuild's project management
features, you will need to tell the compiler the location where
florist is installed, and also tell the linker to link with florist;
for example:

    $ gnatmake -I/<install-prefix>/floristlib main -largs -lflorist

Where <install-prefix> is the path supplied as the --prefix
command line argument to the configure command in the INSTALL
procedure or /usr/local when omitted.
