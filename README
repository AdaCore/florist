FLORIST:

This directory contains the components of FLORIST, an
implementation of the IEEE Standards 1003.5: 1992, IEEE STD
1003.5b: 1996, and parts of IEEE STD 1003.5c: 1998, also known as
the POSIX Ada Bindings.

PREREQUISITES:

You will need GNAT 3.17 or 5.01 to install and compile Florist.  

----------------
--  WARNINGS  --
----------------

This Ada binding implementation depends on your underlying OS
having C header-files and libraries that conform to the POSIX
standards.  It will try to use constants, types, and functions
defined in POSIX.1, POSIX.1b, POSIX.1c, and the proposed POSIX.1g
standard.  The degree to which the Ada binding works and conforms
to the POSIX.5 and POSIX.5b standards will be limited by how well
your OS conforms to the corresponding C API's.

So far, we have not found any operating system that fully supports
POSIX.1c and POSIX.1g though they are getting better.  Generally,
you will get better results with newer OS releases, since their C
API's are closer to the POSIX standards.  It is also a good idea
to make sure that your installation includes the header files and
libraries needed for the real-time and threads extensions.  (The
default "end user" OS installation may try to save you disk space
by not installing them.)

Florist is currently supported on the following configurations. It
may or may not work on non supported configurations:

Sparc/Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7, 8, 9
Linux Redhat 7.x, 8, 9
DEC Unix 4.0x
Tru64 5.1a
HP/UX 11.00
IRIX 6.5
AiX 4.3

NORMAL INSTALLATION:

Follow the steps described in the INSTALL file.

COMPILING YOUR PROGRAMS WITH FLORIST:

To compile your own programs with Florist, you will need to include
the gnatmake parameters that specify where to find the
Florist sources and object library file. Usually the following command
will be enough:

$ gnatmake -Ifloristlib main -largs -lflorist

If you don't want to keep around the whole Florist installation
directory, you should be able to copy or move the subdirectory
"floristlib" to some other location, and then include it in
your GNAT source and object library search paths (see the GNAT documentation
for more details).
