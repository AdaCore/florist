/* SOLARIS_HACK activates a workaround for a trick that appeared
   in the Solaris 2.6 header files, of defining local function bodies
   for certain POSIX function names, which are wrappers that in turn
   call a real library function whose name is of the form __posix_XXX.
 
   ....We need to fix the configuration process to auto-detect this!
