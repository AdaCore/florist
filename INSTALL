In order to install FLORIST, you should go through the following steps:

0. Make sure you have GNAT installed and in front of your PATH.

1. Configure FLORIST by typing "./configure".

   You may want to use the --prefix=/florist/install option to specify
   where to install FLORIST. By default, Florist will be installed
   under /usr/local.

   If you are using a special configuration with no support or non standard
   support for tasking/threads, you may consider using the --disable-threads
   option:

        ./configure --disable-threads

   Note that disabling thread support will remove support for the following
   packages that depend on threads:

     - POSIX.Asynchronous_IO
     - POSIX.Condition_Variables
     - POSIX.Message_Queues
     - POSIX.Mutexes
     - POSIX.Process_Primitives
     - POSIX.Process_Signals
     - POSIX.Timers

2. Build and compile FLORIST by typing "make"

   If you need to specify optional gnatmake flags, or use an alternate
   gnatmake executable, you may specify GNATMAKE="gnatmake-cmd-line", e.g:
      make GNATMAKE="gnatmake --RTS=zcx"

3. Install FLORIST by typing "make install"
