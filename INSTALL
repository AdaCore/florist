In order to install FLORIST, you should go through the following steps:

0. Make sure you have GNAT installed.
   Note that to use FLORIST, you need to either use a GNAT run time based on
   native threads (see GNAT user's guide for more details)
   or use the --disable-threads option at configure time below:

1. Configure FLORIST by typing "./configure".

   You may want to use the --prefix=/florist/install option to specify
   where to install FLORIST. By default, Florist will be installed
   under /usr/local.

   If you are using a GNAT run time that is not using native OS threads,
   you need to specify the --disable-threads option:

        ./configure --disable-threads

   Note that disabling thread support will remove support for the following
   packages that depend on threads:

     - POSIX.Asynchronous_IO
     - POSIX.Condition_Variables
     - POSIX.Message_Queues
     - POSIX.Mutexes
     - POSIX.Process_Primitives
     - POSIX.Process_Signals
     - POSIX.Timers

2. Build and compile FLORIST by typing "make"

3. Install FLORIST by typing "make install"
